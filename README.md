# Demo code for submission "Learning to rank using localized geometry mean metrics"


The program is written by [Julia](http://julialang.org/). Please download the [lastest version](http://julialang.org/downloads/) to execute this demo code.

## Prerequisites

You need to install two packages `MAT` and `Iterators` in the command shell of Julia:
```julia
julia > Pkg.add("MAT")
julia > Pkg.add("Iterators")
```

## Execution

We have prepared a demo program to train two rank lists from MSLR-WEB10K dataset. You can try our program under the project directory and type:

```julia
julia demo_small_dataset.jl
```
